# ORCHESTRATE BACK-END

We are team Caffeine Overflow from Northcoders November 2021 cohort. For our project we came up with the idea for a web application that would allow classical musicians both professional and freelance to book venues and rehearsal spaces as well as to socialise and interact with other musicians within the application.

 ## Build with: 
 
 * Node.JS 
 * MongoDB
 * Mongoose
 * Express
 * Passport JS

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement.

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/Chris-Whitney/orchestrate-be.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ npm install
    
## Difficulties:

Initially, we wanted to use Svelte. However there were several issues with documentation and trying to implement it with the backend that we had put  together. We ultimately decided to drop this tech in favour of React
 
 ## Improvements:
 * Replace Promise by async functions
 * SQL injection vulnerabilities on the models files
 * Use `.route` for endpoints that share the same path
