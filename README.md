# ORCHESTRATE BACK-END

We are team Caffeine Overflow from Northcoders November 2021 cohort. For our project we came up with the idea for a web application that would allow classical musicians both professional and freelance to book venues and rehearsal spaces as well as to socialise and interact with other musicians within the application.

 ## Build with: 
 
 * Node.JS 
 * MongoDB
 * Mongoose
 * Express
 * Passport JS
 * Jest

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environment.

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/Chris-Whitney/orchestrate-be.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ npm install
    
## Difficulties:

We also had a set back with passport JS and express session, specifically with the cookie sessions. This was due to the backend being hoisted and the frontend was being run locally. CORS would not allow credentials to be sent without first being instructed of the origin of delivery. 

 ## Improvements:
 * add more CRUD functions and endpoints
